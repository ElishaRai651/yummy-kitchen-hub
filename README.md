The project “Yummy Kitchen Hub” is a desktop application which we are planned to design to streamline the operations of a restaurant. 
It provides a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of a restaurant, including menu management, order placement, table management, 
sales report, and billing. Our goal is to empower customers with the tools needed to run the establishment smoothly, maximize efficiency, improve 
accuracy and accountability, track sales revenue and deliver a top-notch dining experience.
In today's fast-paced world, the restaurant industry demands efficient management solutions to cater to the growing demands of customers while maintaining
a high level of service quality. Yummy Kitchen Hub addresses these needs by offering a digital platform that simplifies the entire dining process. By integrating 
various functions such as menu browsing, order placement, staff interaction, and administrative control, the system optimizes restaurant operations and enhances 
customer satisfaction.
